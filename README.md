## Description

The Module 3 challenge was to create a random password generator using a script.js file.

The reason for creating a random password generator was to learn more about Javascript methods, for loops, functions, if statements, confirms, alerts, prompts, and events.

I was able to learn more about and become more comfortable with media queries, flexbox, CSS grids, and defining/applying CSS variables throughout this challenge.
