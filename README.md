## Description

The Module 3 challenge was to create a random password generator using a script.js file.

The reason for creating a random password generator was to learn more about Javascript methods, for loops, functions, if statements, confirms, alerts, prompts, and events.

I was able to learn more about and become more comfortable using Javascript methods, for loops, functions, if statements, confirms, alerts, prompts, and events. Therefore, I accomplished everything I was aiming to learn through this challenge.
